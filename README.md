# NextVision
This is a mini-project using a Raspberry Pi 5 and a Pi5 cam that records, live streams feeds, and logs them on the front-end website in real time.

I have used the picamera2 module to use the functionalities of the Raspberry Pi camera. The theme is inspired by cyberpunk. You can change it as you like.

# Use cases
1. It can be used by medical residents/students to record and live stream the operations to have a POV of the actual operation theatre and develop the necessary temperament required during the operations.
  
2. The doctors can send the recorded videos to specialists for consultation and a second opinion.

3. Any field where real-time surveillance is required.
